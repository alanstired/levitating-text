# Unit 1 Final - Many Things Redux
In this project, I decided to experiment with multiple areas of the P5.JS library and make a program with some of the trivial features from the language. Some of these ranged from very useful and essential, such as keypresses, to more interesting and trivial additions, such as the clock. I mainly made this as a little silly way to incoporate as many of the P5 functions that I thought would fit in. 

All of the six things (variables, functions, conditionals, arrays, loops, objects) have been used to be able to create this project.
